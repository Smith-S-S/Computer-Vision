# üë©üèª‚Äçü¶∞Face Attendance

This Python project showcases the implementation of a face recognition-based attendance marking system using Computer Vision techniques. The project leverages the OpenCV, face_recognition, and numpy libraries to achieve the following functionalities: loading images, generating face encodings, real-time face detection and recognition using a webcam, and recording attendance by writing names and timestamps to a CSV file. The project demonstrates the practicality of face recognition technology in automating attendance tracking processes.
